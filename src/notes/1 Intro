Scala is a scalable language for component software with a focus on abstraction, composition and decomposition.

Statically typed, runs on JVM - like Java
Scala blends object-oriented and functional programming in a statically typed language.
-> Uses type interfacing

Java can be used in Scala, and Scala can be used in Java. It is practical.

Mixed Scala/Java projects - use existing Java libraries and tools (Maven, JUnit etc.)

SBT (Scala Build Tool) is an open source build tool for Scala and Java projects, similar to Java's Maven and Ant.
- SBT is a modern build tool. While written in Scala and provides many Scala conveniences, it is a general
  purpose build tool
- SBT is the de facto build tool in Scala

Why SBT?
- Native support for compiling Scala code
- Uses Apache Ivy for dependency management
- Only update-on-request model
- Full Scala language support for creating tasks
- Support for mixed Java/Scala projects
- Launch REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
